Common Gateway Interface (CGI)

A common way to make scripts available online is to upload them to web hosting providers as CGI scripts.
Common Gateway Interface (CGI) is a standard that allows web server software (such as Apache or
Microsoft IIS) to launch programs and send data back and forth between them and the web client.
Many people associate the term CGI with the Perl language, as Perl has been the most common
language with which to write CGI scripts. However, CGI is language agnostic, and you can just as easily write
CGI scripts with Ruby (more easily, in fact!).

In general, however, CGI execution is becoming unpopular due to its lack of speed and the need for
a Ruby interpreter to be executed on every request. This makes CGI unsuitable for high-use or heavy-load
situations.
